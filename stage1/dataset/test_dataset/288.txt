It won’t be easy. First, there is the matter of what’s on the menu: Mexican food. Tacos
and burritos are virtually unknown in <location>Chin</location>a, where many
diners prize aspirational noshes from <location>America</location>,
<location>Japan</location> and <location>Europe</location> and look skeptically
at what they see as poorer fare from other developing countries. Then there is
Taco Bell’s very American take on Mexican meals. Even among fans, many of its
more   menu items are best considered   guilty pleasures. “It’s like a dirty
thing that I love Taco Bell so much,” the actress Anna Kendrick once said on
Conan O’Brien’s talk show, adding, “it has to be under cover of darkness in my
car. ”
