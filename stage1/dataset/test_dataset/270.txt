“I assume they don’t have a strategy yet, so Trump with Abe
by his side was properly taciturn, surprisingly so,” said Jeffrey A. Bader, an
Asia scholar at the Brookings Institution who served as President Barack
Obama’s Asia adviser. “But that can’t hold. At some point you need to

that the missile launched on Sunday by North Korea was either a   or an
missile, according to the American military, and not an intercontinental
missile, or ICBM, capable of reaching the United States. The missile flew 310
miles before dropping harmlessly into the Sea of <location>Japan</location>,
according to the South Korean military, which identified it as an   Musudan.
North Korea regularly tests missiles in violation of <location>United
Nations</location> resolutions, including roughly two dozen last year, but has
boasted that it could test an ICBM “anytime and anywhere. ” The kind tested on
Sunday poses a potential threat to American allies in
<location>Japan</location> and <location>South Korea</location> and American
forces in the Pacific, but could not strike the United States.
