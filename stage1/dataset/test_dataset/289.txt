For its new store in <location>Shanghai</location> such as taco shells
made out of Doritos or fried chicken cutlets. Instead, as it once successfully
did with KFC, Yum China is tailoring the menu to local tastes. It is offering
basic, understandable   fare such as a crunchy taco supreme and a chicken
quesadilla. Other dishes made for the Chinese market include a shrimp and
avocado burrito and a spicy fried chicken dish, a meal that has broader appeal
with the Chinese. And in a feature rare in <location>America </location> —
perhaps for good reason  —   the China store offers Japanese beer and alcoholic
slushes. Yum China is aware of the magnitude of the challenge. Micky Pant, its
chief executive, says eating a taco is “a whole new way of learning. ” The
company is learning its own lessons. In the 1990s, Chinese consumers flocked to
KFC and other Western   chains, drawn by their clean bathrooms and    —   a
novelty in <location>China</location> at that time.
