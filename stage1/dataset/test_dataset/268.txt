Mr. Trump would know that farmers had invested millions of dollars into
produce that is growing right now, and that not being able to pick and sell
those crops would represent huge losses for the state economy. “I’m confident
that he can grasp the magnitude and the anxiety of what’s happening now. ” Mr.
Trump’s immigration policies could transform California’s Central Valley, a
stretch of lowlands that extends from <location>Redding</location> to
<location>Bakersfield</location>. Approximately 70 percent of all farmworkers
here are living in the <location>United States</location> illegally, according
to researchers at University of California, Davis. The impact could reverberate
throughout the valley’s precarious economy, where agriculture is by far the
largest industry. With 6. 5 million people living in the valley, the fields in
this state bring in $35 billion a year and provide more of the nation’s food
than any other state.
