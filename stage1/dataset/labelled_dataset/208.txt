In <location>Escondido</location>, where local radio stations still carry public
service announcements about the   shortage, the AES battery packs are being
installed at a critical spot on the regional electrical grid: the place where
the giant wires from power plants and wind and solar arrays connect to the
network of local wires. The batteries are intended to relieve the pressure on
the system. Mainly, they will serve as a kind of sponge, soaking up excess or
solar energy during the day and then squeezing it back into the grid in the
evening, when demand surges as the sun sets. There is enough capacity in the
containers full of batteries to power about 20, 000 homes for four hours. The
idea is that they help the utility lessen its dependence on the type of natural
gas plants known as “peakers,” which can turn on and off quickly to meet sudden
peaks of demand but are generally used only for short periods and at great
expense. And peakers, by burning fossil fuel, are also at odds with
California’s   goals. The project is also being watched closely by advocates
for renewable energy. The reason: If   battery installations work as designed,
they would help wind or solar generators to act more like conventional
power plants by working steadily even when the sun isn’t shining or the
wind isn’t blowing. “Energy storage is really the tool to do renewables
integration for a utility infrastructure company like us,” said Josh
Gerber, advanced technology integration manager of SDGE, as workers
smoothed the   concrete pads that support the containers at the Escondido
site. “Without it, you have more risk that the variability of renewables is
going to cause reliability problems. ” Under the contract, AES is
responsible for making sure the batteries perform for 10 years, after which
SDGE will take over. One potential downside is that if the batteries are
fully charged and discharged each day, they could degrade more quickly. The
executives involved expressed confidence in the design and reliability,
despite Samsung’s recent smartphone problems. Not only are these batteries
a different configuration than the smartphone units, executives said, but
the larger footprint allows for the inclusion of sophisticated monitoring
as well as industrial safety and cooling and ventilation equipment. The
project, along with the smaller array AES has installed in <location>El
Cajon</location>, could provide the    leap Mr. Gluski has been striving
for. AES has a deal for an even bigger installation in a $1 billion project
in <location>Long Beach</location> with Southern California Edison that is not part of the
<location>Aliso Canyon</location> remediation effort it is projected to go online by the end
of 2020. The electric company plans to use batteries as part of a plan
to replace an aging gas plant along the San Gabriel River. Long term,
Mr. Gluski plans to shift the company’s   portfolio  —   still heavily
based on coal and natural gas  —   toward more renewable energy. He
sees the storage systems as vital components in turning solar and wind
energy into a dominant power source in the parts of <location>Latin
America</location>, <location>Asia</location> and
<location>Africa</location> where AES is active. Whatever progress it
has made, AES still has its share of problems, with $20 billion in debt
and a stock price less than   the value that it had at the start of the
century.
