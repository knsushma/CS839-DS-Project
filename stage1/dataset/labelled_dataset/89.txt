The fallout
included the resignations of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of
<location>Florida</location>, the chairwoman of the D. N. C. and most of her
top party aides. Leading Democrats were sidelined at the height of the

dispute over what evidence exists that President Vladimir V. Putin of
<location>Russia</location> moved beyond mere espionage to deliberately try to
subvert American democracy and pick the winner of the presidential election. While there’s no way to be
certain of the ultimate impact of the hack, this much is clear: A     weapon
that Russia had in elections from <location>Ukraine</location> to <location>Europe</location> was trained on the
<location>United States</location>, with devastating effectiveness.
