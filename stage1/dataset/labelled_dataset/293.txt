Taco Bell may be an unlikely restaurant to connect.
“Chinese people have mostly admired things from
<location>Europe</location> and the <location>United
States</location>,” said Darcy Zhang, a food blogger based in
<location>Shanghai</location>. “But Mexico itself is a
developing country, and so many Chinese people would wonder why
they would have to try Mexican food. ” Yum China formally
opened the Taco Bell on Jan. 9 in <location>Shanghai</location>’s prime Lujiazui
area, a popular tourist spot. The former basketball star
Shaquille O’Neal, who made the famous “Taco Neck” commercial in
1995, participated in a   competition. On a recent Tuesday, the
store was packed at lunch, with a   wait to get a table. Diners
sat on chairs below surfboards suspended from ceilings. Workers
in polo shirts served margaritas and draft beer. “If you didn’t
tell me, I wouldn’t even know this was Mexican food,” said Zang
Jing, 30, a bank clerk, adding that she thought the food was
“not bad. ” Liu Xiaoyi, chief editor of a local food guide,
said she believed Mexican food could take off in
<location>China</location> because people are “willing to try
new things.
