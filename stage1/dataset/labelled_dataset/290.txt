Shanghai restaurant seems intent on easing Chinese diners into
ordering. The menu in <location>China</location> features enlarged images of
foods on a lighted board and a transparent kitchen, where skeptical customers
can watch their food being assembled. Yum dropped fajitas because focus groups
said Chinese people did not like the “peppery type of spiciness that Westerners
like,” said Jimmy Chen, senior director of Yum China’s brand development
division. Chinese consumers wanted warm cheese on their tacos, not the cold
grated variety offered in the <location>United States</location>. They asked
for alcohol to be offered. The bean burrito was “controversial,” Mr. Chen said
while some Chinese who had studied abroad considered it a must, others
found two types of starches layered on top of one another unfamiliar.
Ultimately the bean burrito was booted. Said Mr. Chen, “We just need a
little more time. ” Yum has tried Taco Bell in
<location>China</location> before.
