Until he was appointed manager of a Taco Bell in <location>China</location>,
Will Cao had never seen a taco before. When confronted with its hard,   shell
in <location>Los Angeles</location> last June, he wondered: How do you eat it?
“Everything was spilling all over the place,” said Mr. Cao, a    Shanghai
resident. “Then I looked at the other customers to learn that, actually, you
are supposed to tilt your neck to eat it. ” Mr. Cao’s employer is betting that
other Chinese diners will figure it out. Yum China, the company behind KFC
there, last month opened the first Taco Bell in <location>China</location> in
years, and says it plans to open an unspecified number more. The company is
turning to   tacos and overstuffed quesadillas in hopes of regaining ground in
a market where its fried chicken has shown the limits of its appeal.
