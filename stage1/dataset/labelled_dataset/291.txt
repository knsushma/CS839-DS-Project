In 2003 it opened   restaurants
called “Taco Bell Grande” in <location>Shanghai</location>, then in the
southern city of <location>Shenzhen</location>, offering   fare like
steaks and fajitas. But it pulled out five years later. “They had
little Chinese girls with sombreros on them looking ridiculous,” said
Joel Silverstein, president of the consultancy East West Hospitality
Group and a former senior executive with restaurants, the onetime
parent of Yum Brands. “That was a complete disaster. ” Still, Yum once
seemed to have cracked the China code. Since opening its first KFC near
<location>Tiananmen Square</location> in 1987, Yum has grown into the biggest Western
chain in the country, with more than 7, 300 stores in over 1, 100
cities, three times that of its rival McDonald’s. Part of the secret
was localization: KFC offered fried dough sticks and congee for
breakfast, while its sister brand Pizza Hut served pizzas topped with
seafood and durian, a pungent fruit from Southeast
<location>Asia</location>.
