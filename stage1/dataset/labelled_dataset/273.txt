“I was glad he issued the statement with the prime minister of
<location>Japan</location>, but he ought to do it quickly,” Senator Chuck Schumer of <location>New York</location>, the
Democratic minority leader, said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “South Korea is
probably more susceptible to North Korea’s virulence than any other country. ”
White House officials on Sunday remained quiet about the test and their
emerging strategy. Stephen Miller, the president’s senior adviser for policy,
said Mr. Trump had sent a strong signal with his joint appearance with Mr. Abe.
“But we’re going to be sending another signal very soon, and that signal is
when we begin a great rebuilding of the armed forces of the <location>United
States</location>,” he said, also on “Face the Nation. ” “President Trump is
going to go to Congress and ask them to invest in our military so once again we
will have unquestioned military strength beyond anything anybody can imagine. ”
Short of military action, the menu of options available for Mr. Trump is not
significantly better than it was for his predecessors. The United States and
the United Nations have already imposed an array of wrenching sanctions and
have largely isolated North Korea from much of the world.
