Discreet little clay notices have been found in the petrified ruins of
ancient <location>Pompeii</location> which translate along the lines "strict nanny for
discipline", "French polishing given" and "private massage service
available from willing slaves".  Excavations on the island of <location>Crete</location> have
unearthed 3,000-year-old bulletin boards offering the services of
mercenary soldiers, houris advertised their favours in <location>Persia</location> by
displaying erotic statues in their doorways and in old Cathay there was a
highly organised system of intimate escort agencies catering for all tastes.
 
In 1962, the Bell Telephone Corporation of <location>America</location> were looking for ways
to entice subscribers to spend even more hours running up their phone
bills, and came up with the notion of something called The Private
Party-line.  Human nature being what it is, these dial-a-heavy-breather
services soon degenerated into a mass market for lonely hearts,
sex-starved singles and unsavoury perverts.  In 1973, the US
Telecommunications Authority tried, and failed, to control so-called
SPECIALIST services, where callers could dial up a whole range on
one-to-one conversations and talk dirty.
  
But for every tale of happiness that I have come across, there are a
hundred incidents of deceit, corruption, and criminal incitement.  It
gives me no pleasure to report that festering away deep down among the
bulletin boards there are some highly unpleasant pits:  ranging from Nazi
propaganda in <location>Germany</location>, organised racism in the States, child
prostitution in <location>France</location>, and gay-bashing in <location>Britain</location>.
