There is a principle established by our founding fathers in their
Constitutional compromise that was quite explicit in that a resident of these
<location>United States</location> is held to be innocent until proven guilty and adjudged to be
so by a jury of his peers. In theory, you can be caught red handed running a
lawn mower over piles of human bodies stacked on your front lawn and an FBI
agent or policeman can't find you "guilty" of anything by themselves. They
can detain you on suspicion and present you for prosecution. In fact, judges
cannot actually find you guilty of criminal wrong doing under our system of
justice. Twelve of your uninterested neighbors who are NOT professionally
part of the system have to agree that you are indeed guilty before our system
can mete out a punishment. This current practice of seizing equipment under
color of search warrant abrogates all the protections built into our
Constitutional form of government to preclude this. As such, they constitute
not merely a procedural faux pas, but treason.

Bill Clinton probably doesn't read all his e-mail at
75300.3115@compuserve.com. But somebody will have to. And your elected
representative in <location>Washington</location> would be a good follow up. They won't know
there's a problem if you don't tell them. It's a sure bet the SPA is unlikely
to carry the torch for you. There's twelve million of you online. And if you
don't want to have to apply for the government's permission for every
tagline, we'd better get in motion.

Five years ago, Bob Fairburn had a heart attack. A restaurant manager in
<location>Kansas</location> with a wife and children, Fairburn could not obtain life insurance and
was assured by doctors that he had a life expectancy of five years or less.
He pondered for months on how he could somehow assure his family an income
after his death. And he decided that there were two things a man could do in
America to generate ongoing income - write a book or invent something.

Fairburn decided shareware wasn't the way to go to generate cash. So he
solicited software distributors for months. Eventually, a company in <location>Florida</location>
called Expert Software picked up the title and launched Expert Home Design -
at the staggering price of $14.95 retail.

Fairburn called the FBI office in <location>Kansas</location> City and complained. They were quite
nice but not very helpful during the call. But about a month later, Fairburn
answered a knock on the door to find an FBI agent on the front porch - there
to investigate his problem. Fairburn took the agent into the den and logged
onto Rusty & Edie's BBS. They logged the session to disk and he showed him
not only his own program in the directory, but copies of Borland's Software,
Novell's LAN software, a number of Microsoft programs, Quicken, and according
to Fairburn, "virtually every commercial game program made."

Fairburn was discouraged to learn that the agent knew nothing about
computers. But he gave him a disk with the logged session on it, some files
they actually downloaded, and a copy of PKZIP so he could extract the files.
He patiently explained what PKZIP did, and why it needed to be done. The
agent thanked him and left - telling him they would turn it over to their
<location>Cleveland</location> office.
