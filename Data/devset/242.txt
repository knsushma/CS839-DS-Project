	The First and Fourth Amendments (ensuring free speech and 
protection against unreasonable search and seizure) became dust in 
the wind on March 1, in <location>Austin</location>, <location>Texas</location>,
when US Secret Service busted 
Steve Jackson Games for no reason anyone can explain. The firm was 
preparing to market a Dungeons and Dragons-type game called GURPS 
Cyberpunk when the feds raided its headquarters, seized the 
computers the company was using both to create the game and 
maintain a computer-bulletin-board system (BBS) for dialog with its 
customers. The feds also confiscated software, company records and 
all available drafts of the book. Law enforcement officials even tried 
to pry open locked file cabinets with letter openers they found on 
employees' desks.

	Steve Jackson Games appears to have been an early-year victim 
of a federal war against "hackers" - persons who gain unauthorized 
access to other people's computers - that began with a raid in <location>Arizona</location>
on May 8 and escalated into a nationwide sweep known as Operation 
SunDevil covering 14 cities and involving more than 150 Secret 
Service agents.

	The Secret Service held the confiscated material for three 
months while Jackson tried, in vain, to find out why it had been seized 
in the first place. According to attorney Sharon Beckman, of the <location>Boston</location>
law firm Silvergate & Good, which represents the company, the 
government's application for a search warrant - which would describe 
what its agents were after - has never been released. "So far, I haven't 
heard anything to indicate probable cause," she says.

	At least one expert from an unlikely quarter agrees. Dorothy E. 
Denning, of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), has prepared a paper 
to be presented to the National Computer Conference in <location>Washington</location>
next month in which she recommends that she and her fellow security 
professionals "work closely with hackers."

	Perhaps the most troubling example of the government's blind 
zeal concerns the Jolnet BBS, in <location>Illinois</location>. Its operator, Richard Andrews, 
discovered in storage on his system (again, thanks to Riggs) the 
infamous 911 document that Phrack later published. He suspected 
something illegal and asked the advice of a friend, who notified the 
phone company in an effort to set things right. Government agents 
shut down the Jolnet BBS and seized Andrew's equipment last 
December; they still have yet to return any equipment or to charge 
Andrews.

	The EFF, in its mission statement, recognizes the lack of law and 
legal precedent in the electronic frontier and warns that "in their 
absence, law-enforcement agencies like the Secret Service and FBI, 
acting at the disposal of large information corporations, are seeking to 
create legal precedents which would radically limit Constitutional 
application to digital media."

	"The excesses of Operation SunDevil are only the beginning of 
what threatens to become a long, difficult, and philosophically obscure 
struggle between institutional control and individual liberty."
