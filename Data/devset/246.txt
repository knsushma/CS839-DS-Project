As a teenager growing up in <location>Ann Arbor</location>, <location>Michigan</location>,
in the late 1950's he had a comsuming passion for telephones and computers. During the summer he worked
for an independent phone equipment manufacturer and spent time hanging around
the offices of Michigan Bell. He also made some friends within Bell.
    Naturally curious, Maxfield experimented with his telephone at home and
learned how to blow fuses at distant switching stations and even how to shut
down whole portions of an exchange. By studying AT&T technical journals used
on his job and by picking up technical information from his contacts at Bell,
he learned how to make his own blue box. In 1961, when dirrect dial service
reached <location>Ann Arbor</location>, Maxfield was finally able to test his discovery.
    "I put a lot of trust in the work he does," says Donn Parker, a computer
crime expert at SRI International, in <location>Menlo Park</location>, <location>California</location>, and a regular
subscriber to Maxfield's reports. "He does a very good job of keeping track of
the malicious hackers and the phone phreak community."
