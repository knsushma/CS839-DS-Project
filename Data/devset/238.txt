   Based on information posted on a bulletin board it operated, the <location>Austin</location>
Police Department said it has been able to turn off two pirate boards here and
expects shortly to make a number of arrests for misdemeanor violations of
<location>Texas</location>' newly enacted computer crime law.

   The <location>Austin</location> police department disclosure caught most of the board's users by
surprise.  "I liked the board's electronic messaging capabilities," said user
Michael Whalen, the managing editor of the Daily Texan, the student newspaper
of the University of <location>Texas</location> here.  "I was really surprised at how the officer
was able to pull this off."

   What the police found, according to Ansley, included access codes belonging
to the world's largest credit reporting organization, TRW Information Services
Systems Division of Orange, California.  "Most offenders seem to be real big on
TRW," said Ansley.

   "You better believe law enforcement agencies are interested and, in some
cases, running bulletin boards," said Dan Pasquale, a sergeant with the
<location>Fremont</location>, <location>California</location>, police department.  Last month, police in Fremont capped
three and a half months of bulletin board operations by arresting eight
individuals for alleged credit card fraud, misuse of telephone credit card
operations, and technical trespass.  Pasquale said most corporations whose
passwords or calling card numbers were posted on Fremont's board were unaware
that their information had been compromised.
