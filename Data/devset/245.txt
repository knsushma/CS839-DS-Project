     When Linda N. Paris opened the August, 1989, phone bill for
Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., the telecommunications manager was
stunned.  On a single day, more than 6,000 calls had been placed
from the telephone switch that serves the company's two papers,
the "Inquirer" and the "Daily News," to numbers in <location>Pakistan</location>,
<location>Egypt</location>, and the <location>Dominican Republic</location>--places Philadelphia reporters
rarely call.  During the month, such calls added up to about
$90,000--nearly a quarter of the Knight-Ridder Inc. unit's entire
phone bill.

     EVASIVE MANEUVERS.  Thieves who sell the codes are a bigger
problem.  "Call-sell" operations, run from pay phones or out of
apartments, offer illegal toll calling for a cash payment. 
Security officials at MCI Communications Corp. say that call-
selling began in <location>NYC</location> but in the past year has spread to <location>LA</location>,
<location>Chicago</location>, and other cities.  Last April, MCI led investigators to
a man and a woman in upper Manhattan whose call-sell operation
ran up more than $178,000 in charges to unwitting companies. 
They pleaded guilty last fall to state grand larceny and
computer-trespass charges.

     More often, though, the lawbreakers disappear without a
trace.  To evade detection, they use a technique known as
"looping."  They break into one PBX, but instead of dialing the
final destination from there, they tap into a second PBX and then
complete the call.  That makes it harder to track the caller. 
Even if they're caught, PBX hackers usually get off lightly
because judges don't regard such fraud as a major crime.  The two
operators in <location>New York</location> were sentenced to perform community
service.
