It is easier to get a winning six-digit combination in the lottery than to
illegally acquire the password of a BTX subscriber, Bildschirmtext experts at
the Bundespost had boasted.  But that is exactly what the computer chaotics did
straight away.  An error, in professional circles called a bug, in the system's
computer program made it as simple as child's play for the hackers.  Many
Bildschirmtext users had already noticed that there was something wrong with
the program.

In BTX's country of origin, <location>Great Britain</location>, hackers made a game out of cracking
Prince Philip's electronic mailbox.  The BTX mailboxes are definitely oddly
constructed.  Bildschirmtext letters that have already been mailed can be
rewritten later by the sender.  Any mailbox can even be rendered fully
inoperative.  In order to do so, all that is required--as the Hamburg Chaos
hackers also discovered--is that the command to repeat the entire call-in be
placed at the end of a page edit.  The page drawn up in this way then appears
repeatedly.  It also does so in the mailbox to which it is sent, the result
being that nothing else can be retrieved from it.  Only the Bundespost knows
how to break up this vicious cycle.

The BTX control facility in Ulm is not that interesting as a test object.  It
tries to keep the system running.  And the <location>Berlin</location> office of BTX is responsible
for calming down postal customers when something goes wrong.  The Central
Telecommunications Office (FTZ) in Darmstadt is the site where technical plans
and standards are drawn up.  There one might expect to find the practical
technicians who worked out the security system.  Those are the right people for
a test of BTX weaknesses.  Without giving it much more thought, the BTX
connection of the FTZ was tested one day by the CCC:  Do they or do they not
have free access?  In order to find out, their subscriber number had to first
be entered:  06151 83.  That is the telephone number for the FTZ.  Then there
is the prompt for the code word.  At this point, you can type in anything and
tell from the subsequent error message whether the FTZ has a free-access
connection or not.  The CCC typed something in, the same telephone number
again.  The FTZ was careless:  There was free access.  But even worse, the FTZ
had chosen its own telephone number as its secret code word.  That is clearly
more careless than one would have expected, certainly from Bundespost
specialists.

Almost everything went as planned.  Over night, in 12 hours and 59 minutes, a
good DM 134,000 was raised.  With a portabfen run in a
daily newspaper, and a meeting of two dozen people from all over West Germany
then took place in <location>Berlin</location>.  We then decided to keep in touch and exchange
experiences.  The idea was simply to put together a magazine, but at that point
it was all too vague, and it didn't come off.  Next, contacts with the <location>United
States</location> were established, with Cheshire Catalyst (the "king" of U.S. hackers,
Ed.) and with his magazine TAP, which a bunch of people here in <location>West Germany</location>
already knew about and subscribed to.  At the Telecom in the fall of 1983, I
met him personally and wrote a two-page article about him in a daily newspaper. 
And this two-page article elicited a great deal of response.  By the end of the
year, things had progressed far enough to set up a magazine.  Previously, the
idea was to exchange all information by floppy disk, but everything was
incompatible, and it had no purpose.  The magazine was announced around the
beginning of the year, and we received 100 replies within one week.  And so to
us in <location>Hamburg</location>, it was obvious:  If 100 people want it, then it has to be done. 
In March, the first issue was finally finished.  Once the first and second
issues were out, there was a veritable flood of letters.  The amount of mail
was equivalent to placing both my hands on end.

"Blue Bazoobi":  The project builds computers.  Small portable terminals to
control air pressure valves.  DM 20,000 a piece.  Sold to <location>Singapore</location>, <location>Brazil</location> and
<location>China</location>.  The market niche is an area of application that is not feasible for the
pros, due to a lack of large volume.  There are fifty copies right now.  The
"Flying Robert" project will be financed with the money earned.  So things are
coming along.  A broad field of activity is opening up.
