The Davis bust sent a chill throughout the national computer community, said 
Jack Rickard, editor and publisher of Boardwatch magazine, a bulletin board 
newsletter published in <location>Littleton</location>, <location>Colo</location>.  "It's causing chaos," he said.  
Rickard said <location>Oklahoma</location> City is being viewed "a little bit like clown city" in 
computer circles, since the explicit material Davis offered can be purchased 
in nearly every computer magazine and is carried by numerous bulletin boards.  
"This is off the shelf," he said.  "It's considered pretty mundane stuff."

Widespread availability is not a defense, however, attorney Holmes said.  The 
allegedly illegal material was contained on four read-only memory compact 
discs and represented only a fraction of information offered by Davis.

<location>Oklahoma</location> City police referred questions on the Davis case to the district 
attorney's office.  An assistant prosecutor handling the case referred 
questions to District Attorney Bob Macy, who did not return several phone 
calls.

Holmes, a former <location>Cleveland</location> County prosecutor, calls pornography law 
"an extremely broad statute." "I'm not sure it wouldn't include Playboy or 
Penthouse type publications," he said.
