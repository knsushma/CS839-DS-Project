Convicted computer criminal Justin Tanner Petersen was captured Monday in
<location>Los Angeles</location>, 10 months after federal authorities said they discovered he
had begun living a dual life as thier informant and an outlaw hacker.

Petersen, 34, was arrested about 3:30 a.m. outside a Westwood apartment
that FBI agnets had placed under surveillance, said Assistant
Attorney David Schindler.

A flamboyant hacker known in the computer world as "Agent Steal," Petersen
was being held without bail in the federal detention center in <location>Los Angeles</location>.

Petersen faces a maximum of 40 years in prison for using his sophisticated
computer skills to rig a radio contest in <location>Los Angeles</location>, tap telephone lines
and enrich himself with credit cards.

The deal fell apart Oct. 22.  Petersen admitted that he had not given up 
computer crime, but somehow managed to slip out of the federal courthouse
in <location>Los Angeles</location>.

Several weeks ago, a man who identified himself as Petersen called the Daily
News from an undisclosed location.  Petersen's mother later confirmed the 
caller was him.

Petersen said he was living comfortably outside the <location>United States</location> and working
as a bartender.  He predicted he wouldn't be caught.

When that and other misdeeds began to catch up with him, Petersen said, he 
fled to <location>Dallas</location>, where he assumed the alias Samuel Grossman and continued 
using computers to make money illegally.

In the summer of 1991 in <location>Dallas</location>, Petersen was pulled over driving a stolen
Porsche and was arrested on charges that he had broken into credit bureau
computers as part of a credit card scheme.

He said he spent the next four months in prison, negotiating for his freedom
with the promise that he would act as an informant in <location>Los Angeles</location>.

The FBI paid his rent and utilities and gave him $200 a week for spending
money and medical insurance, Petersen said.
