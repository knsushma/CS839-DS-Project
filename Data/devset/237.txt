About litigation involving BBSs in <location>USA</location>.

Several cases of this nature have, or are currently being faught
around the country.  These files are being circulated to inform those
who use or run BBS's of pending legislation in <location>Michigan</location> and <location>Indiana</location>. 

  Unilateral imposition of business rates on Bulletin Board Systems
continues to spread. BBS operators in Indiana complain that GTE is
forcing them to accept extra-cost business rates rather than the
residential rates they have been paying.
  Derry Nelson, sysop of the 1149 BBS in <location>Elkhart</location>, <location>Ind</location>., says that the
changes were a surprise.  The worst part of the surprise seems to be the
large jump in monthly rates.  A typical BBS would find its monthly bill
increased by almost 200 percent.
  "To the best of my knowledge the BBS Community was not aware of the
changes GTE requested in their [new] tariff," Nelson said.  "I know that
I personally wasn't aware of anything until I received a letter from GTE
stating that my rate classification was being changed from Residential to
Business.  I honestly believe that this [tariff] was `slipped' through."
  The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) told Nelson and other
sysops that a tariff approving business rates for home computer lines was
approved in January.  The consensus among ELkhart BBS operators seems to
be that the tariff should have considered in open and publicized hearings.
  The new tariff appears to give GTE wide-ranging control over its
customers.  As an example, the company can limit the length of calls "when
in [GTE's] judgement such action is necessary." GTE claims authority to
change a BBS to business rates because the service is provided "for use
[of] the general public."
