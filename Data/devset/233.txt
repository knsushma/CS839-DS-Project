One of the individuals that supplies me with information from time to time
has uncovered a lot of abuse within the ADS systems, not only here in the
United States, but in <location>England</location> and <location>Italy</location>.  I talk to this individual on a
private bulletin board...

   The major phase of [the Telemail investigation] was about 20 individuals
that we had located and identified and we're looking for indictments on most of
them coming down in the next month or two.  We're talking about a group of
highly organized people that do communicate on a daily basis all the way across
the country -- from <location>San Francisco</location> and <location>L.A.</location> 
to <location>Denver</location> to upstate <location>New York</location>.
So we have a core of individuals that we are still looking at that are using your
system and then we have this peripheral that we are not as concerned about
because they are not part of an out & out conpiracy or an organized network,
per se.  I know of at least 8 or 10 that are the central figures in this, the
carryover from Telemail.  And we keep hearing information of other people who
are calling in with junk messages--there's no real substance to their messages.
Now the reason I know that is that they have included on of my sources of
information onto their system and so he gets messages from the other parties.

   We'd like to make it clear that we don't intend to do this kind of thing
very often, since rumours about certain people being informatns are very common
in this business.  But this is no rumour.  This, friends, is solid fact -- we
would not have printed this story if we were'nt able to substantiate the claims
it makes, and we had no trouble at all doing that.  Our intent is making this
information known was not to screw up the FBI's fun (they're really not doing
all that much out of the ordinary anyway), but rather to expose a very
dangerous individual who goes by the name of Cable Pair (some say his real name
is John Maxfield).  This person has been posing as an extremely friendly hacker
who lives in <location>Detroit</location> and is just bubbling over with technical information in
exchange for your secrets.  He claims to have been one of the nation's first
phreaks, which may or may not be true.  He gives out his telephone numbers
freely, will do anything to communicate with somebody (like place conference
calls on his own private PBX system, provided you give him YOUR phone number),
and generally will use anything you say to him against you in the future.  Our
advice is simple:  stay the hell away fromthis person.  Even if you haven't
done anything wrong yourself, your life can still be made miserable by him if
you're even suspected of having contact with wrongdoers.
