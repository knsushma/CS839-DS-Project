America, a  two-year  old long  distance  telephone service  based  in
<location>Camden</location>, Asbell said.
    Most of the members of the alleged ring live in <location>Camden</location> County, all
are males, and the oldest is 20, he said.
    "We have taped conversations between the computer hackers," Asbell
said.  "We have calls throughout probably most of the <location>United States</location>...
Once you have the access code to Dial America, you can go trade it  to
somebody in  the  state of  Oregon  for the  access  code to  VISA  or
Mastercard."
    Dial America says it has 4,000 customers in <location>Burlington</location>, <location>Gloucester</location>
and <location>Camden</location> Counties.
    "Unless you are from <location>South Jersey</location>, you couldn't use our  service,"
Kreckel said.  "They would get on there and make long-distance  calls.
For example, one says, 'Do you have Pac-Man?  OK, transmit it to  me.'
And in return, he might give him Donkey Kong, then pirate video  games
and send them back and forth."
    At each house, Asbell said, the parents reacted with "actual shock
and dismay as to what was taking place."
    He said  the  parents were  "very  cooperative in  the  first  two
instances"  but  that  the  Cherry  HIll  brothers'  father  initially
resisted the investigators' efforts.
    "They don't realize that stealing from a Dial America, or a Sprint
or MCI, is no different from walking into a 7-Eleven and stealing five
or six thousand dollars," Kreckel said.
    The ability of long-distance  companies to trace fraudulent  usage
has improved measurably in the last year, Kreckel said.
    "When the long distance-industry was  in a different stage a  year
ago, computer hackers found it pretty easy to get into systems without
being detected," he  said.  "But  nowadays, it's such  a stupid  crime
because it's so easy to catch them."
    "The sad part about it is  it's almost 95 percent minors that  are
involved in  this thing.   And that's  the case  with almost  all  the
computer hackers."
