The U.S. Secret Service has seized computer equipment from two
Austin homes and a local business in the past month as part of a federal
investigation into electronic tampering with the nation's 911 emergency
network.
Armed Secret Service agents, accompanied by officers from the <location>Austin</location>
Police Department, took the equipment in three March 1 raids that sources
say are linked to a nationwide federal inquiry coordinated by the Secret
Service and the U.S. attorney's office in <location>Chicago</location>.
While federal officials have declined to comment on the investigation
- which focuses on a bizarre mix of science fiction and allegations of
high-tech thievery - the Austin American-Statesman has learned that the
raids targeted Steve Jackson Games, a South Austin publisher of role-
playing games, and the home of Loyd Blankenship, managing editor at the
company.
A second Austin home, whose resident was acquainted with Jackson
officials, also was raided.
Jackson said there is no reason for the company to be investigated
.Steve Jackson Games is a book and game publisher of fiction, he said,
and it is not involved in any computer-related thefts.
The agents, executing search warrants now sealed by a judge from
public view, took computer equipment, including modems, printers, and
monitors, as well as manuals, instruction books and other documents.  The
equipment has been forwarded to federal officials in <location>Chicago</location>.
The Secret Service, best-known for protecting the president, has
jurisdiction in the case, government officials say, because damage to
the nation's telephone system could harm the public's welfare.  In
addition, the system is run by American Telephone & Telegraph Co., a
company involved in the nation's defense.
The 911 investigation already has resulted in the indictment of
two computer "hackers" in <location>Illinois</location> and sources say federal authorities
now are focusing on Austin's ties to a shadowy underground computer
user's group known as the Legion of Doom.
The hackers, who live in <location>Georgia</location> and 
<location>Missouri</location>, where indicted in
<location>Chicago</location>.  they are believed to be members of the Legion of Doom and
are charged with seven counts, including interstate transportation of
stolen property, wire fraud, and violations of the Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act of 1986.
The government alleges that the defendants stole a computerized
copy of Bell South's system that controls 911 emergency calls in nine
states.  The information was then transferred to a computer bulletin
board and published in a hacker publication known as Phrack!
A trial in the case is scheduled to begin in June.
U.S. agents also have seized the final drafts of a science
fiction game written by the Austin-based game company.  Sources say
the agents are trying to determine whether the game - a dark, futur-
istic account of a world where technology has gone awry - is being
used as a handbook for computer crime.  Steve Jackson, the owner of
the local company and a well-known figure in the role-playing game
industry, said neither he nor his company has been involved in
tampering with the 911 system.
No one in <location>Austin</location> has been indicted or arrested as a result of
the investigation.  "It is an on-going investigation.  That is all
I can say," said Steve Beauchamp, special agent-in-charge of the
Secret Service Austin field office.  "Until we can put it all
together, we just do not comment," he said.
Bob Rogers, Jackson's Dallas attorney, said federal officials
have assured him that neither Jackson nor Jackson Games is the tar-
get of the probe.  The authorities would not tell Rogers whether the
inquiry focused on other company employees.  As for the science fiction
game, called Cyberpunk, Jackson said federal authorities have mistaken
a fictional work for a technical manual [E.N. Why does this sound all
too familiar?] .
"It's not a manual for computer crime any more than a Reader's
Digest story on how to burglar-proof your house is a manual for
burglars," said Jackson, 36.  "It's kind of like the hints you get
on safe-cracking from a James Bond movie."
Blankenship, the author of the book, said his attorney has advised
him not to comment on the book or the Secret Service investigation.
Jackson said he guesses his company was linked to the 911 probe
by its use of a computer bulletin board system, called Usenet.  The
board, one of hundreds throughout the country, is a sort of electronic
Town Square, where personal computer users from throughout the world
can tap into the system via phone lines and a modem.
The network, free and relatively unregulated, is an information
exchange where users can post information, exchange electronic messages
and debate with keyboards everything from poetry and politics to nuclear
war.
One of the world's largest networks - boasting more than 600,000
users - Usenet was tapped by Chinese students in <location>North America</location> to
organize support for students during the pro-democracy demonstrations
last year.  The network also was infected in 1988 by a now-famous
computer "virus" unleashed by college student Robert Morris.
Jackson said his company has maintained a bulletin board on
the Usenet network on which it posts advanced copies of its role-
playing games.  The firm posts the games and requests that the users
of the network comment on the text and propose improvements.
The Jackson bulletin board, called Illuminati, greets users with
the company's logo and a message that states: "Welcome to the World's
Oldest and Largest Secret Conspiracy."
In the <location>Chicago</location> indictment accuses the group of a litany of
electronic abuses, including: disrupting telephone service by
changing the routing of telephone calls; stealing and modifying
individual credit histories; stealing money and property from
companies by altering computer information; and disseminating
information about attacking computers to other computer hackers.
