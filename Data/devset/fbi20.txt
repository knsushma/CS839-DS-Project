30 Arrests In Silicon Valley Computer Parts Sting 01/13/93
SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1993 JAN 13 (NB) -- The
computer and software industries are a high source of revenue
for California. But they also afford a good income for the
criminal elements. An undercover investigation into stolen computer
parts by local and federal authorities and the FBI in Silicon Valley
has resulted in 30 arrests, according to a published report.

UPI reports the operation resulted in the recovery of more than $3.6
million in cash and stolen property and was the result of a 4.5-month
investigation called "Operation Gray Chip." A total of $2.1
million was recovered in cash and another $1.55 million in
stolen high-tech equipment, the report says.

UPI quotes Santa Clara Police Sgt. Mark Kerby as saying: "The
trade in stolen computer parts is one of the largest crime
problems in the Silicon Valley. So I'd say we just scratched the
surface. But hopefully the publicity this case will receive
will serve as a warning."

Various locations, from parking lots to restaurants, were used
to stage the stings. The arrests occurred after cash changed
hands. The largest transaction involved $250,000 in exchange
for 5, 000 Intel computer parts.
