Several bags containing computer books and printouts were confis-
cated, and the group was booted out of the mall. <location>Arlington</location> pol-
ice, who described the incident as a Secret Service matter, were
on the scene but arrested no one.

Special Agent David Adams, an agency spokesman, would neither
confirm nor deny agency involvement in the Pentagon City in-
cident, which involved a group called the 2600 Meeting, named
after a <location>New York</location>-based magazine for hackers.
 
Like members of similarly named groups in <location>New York</location>, <location>San Francisco</location>
and several other cities, the <location>Washington</location> group meets on the first
Friday of each month. Each group's meetings take place in public,
and at least some members apparently are accustomed to scrutiny
by federal agents. A recent advertisement in 2600 promoting a
meeting in <location>New York</location> encouraged members to "come by, drop off ar-
ticles, ask questions, find the undercover agents."
 
News about Friday's incident quickly spread on electronic bul-
letin boards across the country, and computer users from <location>New York</location>
to <location>California</location>'s Silicon Valley have flooded on-line forums with
complaints that the hackers were harassed without being charged
with any crime.

"Their concern is, the government is singling out a group and
trampling on their civil liberties," said John McMullen, a
university computer teacher and <location>New York</location> correspondent for News-
bytes, a computer news service.  According to several members of
the hackers' group, Friday's incident began about 6 p.m., shortly
after group members had pushed tables together in the mall's Food
Court.
 
The officer "said they were working with the Secret Service, and
therefore they had the right to do what they were doing," said
the student, who lives in <location>Arlington</location>.
