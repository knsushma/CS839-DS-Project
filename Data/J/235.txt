“I called it my weekend in <location>Moscow</location>,” Mr. Trump said of his
2013 trip to <location>Moscow</location> during a September 2015 interview on
“The Hugh Hewitt Show. ” He added: “I was with the   people, both oligarchs and
generals, and top of the government people. I can’t go further than that, but I
will tell you that I met the top people, and the relationship was
extraordinary. ” When asked about Mr. Trump’s claim that he had “stayed away”
from <location>Russia</location>, Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said it
was a fair characterization given that none of the development opportunities
ever materialized. Mr. Trump’s interest in <location>Russia</location>, he
said, was no different from his attraction to other emerging markets in which
he investigated possible ventures. Mr. Garten did not respond to questions
about whom Mr. Trump met with in <location>Moscow</location> in 2013 and what
was discussed. Ted Liebman, an architect based in <location>New
York</location>, got the call in 1996.
