Three weeks in office, the Trump administration is still trying to find its footing 
on foreign policy, especially in areas like North Korea that have not been Mr. Trump’s
main focus. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson was sworn in on Feb. 1 and does
not even have a deputy, much less a full team of trusted advisers, in place.
That North Korea’s latest test came while Mr. Trump was hosting Mr. Abe for a
multiday set of meetings, meals and golfing, first at the White House and then
at Mr. Trump’s    estate in <location>Palm Beach</location>,
<location>Fla</location>. was seen as no accident. And it may be that Mr. Abe
counseled Mr. Trump on his response. In his own comments while he stood beside
Mr. Trump, Mr. Abe called the launch “absolutely intolerable. ” Asia experts
and members of Congress praised Mr. Trump for reaffirming American support for
Japan but lamented that he did not mention South Korea at the same time.
