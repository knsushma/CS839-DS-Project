Mr. Garten did not respond to questions
about whom Mr. Trump met with in <location>Moscow</location> in 2013 and what
was discussed. Ted Liebman, an architect based in <location>New
York</location>, got the call in 1996. Mr. Trump and   an American tobacco
company that owned property in <location>Moscow</location>, wanted to build a
residential development near an old Russian Olympic stadium. As they prepared
to meet with officials in <location>Moscow</location>, they needed sketches of
the Trump tower they envisioned. The architect scrambled to meet the request,
handing over plans to Mr. Trump at his Manhattan office. “I hope we can do
this,” Mr. Liebman recalled Mr. Trump telling him. Soon after, Mr. Trump was in
<location>Russia</location>, promoting the proposal and singing the praises of
the Russian market. “I’ve seen cities all over the world. Some I’ve liked, some
I haven’t,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference in <location>Moscow</location>
in 1996, according to The Moscow Times.
