But in recent years Yum has grappled with a
series of   scandals in <location>China</location>. In 2012, Chinese
news media reported that KFC chicken suppliers used antibiotics and
growth hormones in their meat, news that hurt sales and prompted Yum to
cut its number of suppliers. The company emphasized that its food was
safe. Two years later, a Chinese   broadcaster reported that a meat
supplier used by Yum was suspected of selling expired meat. Yum
terminated the supplier, which was later fined about $3. 5 million by
regulators in <location>Shanghai</location>. Sales growth weakened
after both episodes, and by 2015 sales at stores that had been open for
at least a year continued to decline. Adding to the decline: an
increasingly sophisticated customer base that eschews Western fast food
for other options. “The biggest challenge is making the connection with
the younger generation,” said Ye Liyan, marketing director in China
for Pizza Hut. In its own effort to refurbish, Pizza Hut is rolling
out “concept stores” across China  —   in
<location>Shanghai</location>, one features a robot waiter and
a table with a   screen for customers to build their own
pizzas.
