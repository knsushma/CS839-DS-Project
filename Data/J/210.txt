me,” Barbara L. McQuade, a United States attorney for the
Eastern District of <location>Michigan</location>, said at a news conference in
<location>Detroit</location>. “The risk they allowed is really reprehensible,”
she said. “We want auto suppliers to know they have to put safety ahead of

indictments are the latest moves by the outgoing Obama administration to come
down harder on   crime, including guilty pleas from companies and charges
against individual managers and executives. Federal prosecutors this week also

are seen as a departure from the years following the 2008 financial crisis,
when not a single top bank executive went to prison, fueling a public outcry
over the perception that Wall Street giants were “too big to jail. ” Takata’s
executives are accused of especially egregious conduct. According to the

safety data that continued for as long as 15 years. They knew as early as 2000
that the airbags’ metal inflaters could explode, prosecutors said.
