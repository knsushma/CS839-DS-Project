“Having a great time hosting
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the <location>United States</location>!” Mr.
Trump’s post said. This, after all, was the point of inviting Mr. Abe to his
resort in <location>Palm Beach</location>: a chance to have a   weekend hosting
a foreign leader with whom he has said he wants to develop a close
relationship. It allowed Mr. Trump to capitalize on some unscripted moments
after an initial period in office marred by antagonistic exchanges with some
foreign leaders. The news media blackout was nothing unusual in the annals of
presidential free time. President Barack Obama routinely played golf out of
sight of the press pool that traveled with him, only occasionally allowing a
glimpse of him taking a swing or interacting with his partners. But it was the
latest reminder that Mr. Trump’s presidency is mixing his official role with
the business that bears his name. Mr. Abe’s visit was the first of what Mr.
Trump’s top aides say will be many in which he uses    the     and   castle on
<location>Florida</location>’s Gold Coast, as a setting for forging
relationships with important world leaders.
