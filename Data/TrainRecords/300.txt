hrysler is expanding its American output of trucks, it still relies on its
factory in <location>Saltillo</location>, <location>Mexico</location>, for 30
to 40 percent of its pickups, the analysts say. Ford, by contrast, makes its
pickups at three plants in the <location>United States</location>. Automakers
do not reveal profit margins on particular vehicles. But companies pay workers
less than $10 an hour in <location>Mexico</location>, versus the top union
wage of $29 in American plants. That differential makes Mexican trucks more
profitable for G. M. and Fiat Chrysler than those produced in the
<location>United States</location>.
