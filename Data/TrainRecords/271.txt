“It’s yet unclear what missile was tested,” said Thomas Karako, a missile expert 
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
<location>Washington</location>. “What is certain is that North Korea has now
begun 2017 by continuing the aggressive pace of missile testing they’ve shown
in recent years. ” North Korea challenged Mr. Obama early in his tenure, too,
with an underground nuclear blast four months after he took office. The effect
was to harden Mr. Obama’s attitude toward North Korea for the rest of his
presidency, according to former aides. Rather than try to negotiate, as both
Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush did, Mr. Obama focused on tightening
international sanctions and bolstering alliances with
<location>Japan</location> and <location>South Korea</location>.
