President Obama has said that Mr.
Mateen “took in extremist information and propaganda over the internet and
became radicalized. ” Federal investigators do not believe that Mr. Mateen, who
was 29 and who was killed by the police after the shooting, received any
specific training or support from the Islamic State. Part of their inquiry has
focused on whether anyone in the <location>United States</location> assisted in
his plans for the attack. There has perhaps been no figure more central to
those questions than Ms. Salman, who grew up in an   home in
<location>Rodeo</location>, <location>Calif</location>. near <location>San
Francisco</location>. In Rodeo, on a diverse block populated by Chinese,
Indian, Korean and Mexican families, neighbors recalled a younger Ms. Salman as
warm and kind. Ms. Salman married Mr. Mateen in a ceremony near her childhood
home in Northern <location>California</location>, a second marriage for both.
