Five people were killed early Monday at a crowded nightclub in the popular
Caribbean tourist destination of <location>Playa del Carmen</location>,
<location>Mexico</location>, when an armed man who had been denied entry opened
fire inside the club, prompting a gun battle and a stampede, officials said.
Four of the victims, including three members of the security team that had
blocked the gunman’s entry, were hit by bullets, and the fifth victim was
trampled in the resulting pandemonium, the authorities said. The shooting
occurred at the Blue Parrot nightclub, which was hosting the final night of the
BPM Festival, an international electronic music event that draws fans from
around the world. The gunman entered the club around 2:30 a. m. but was turned
away at the door because he was carrying a weapon, said Miguel Ángel Pech, on
the Yucatán Peninsula. The man then opened fire, and as patrons threw
themselves to the ground or rushed for the exits, security guards at the club
“repelled” the attacker, Mr. Pech said, adding that the guards were apparently
armed. The victims included two Canadians, a Colombian, an Italian and a
Mexican, and at least 15 other people were injured, including at least three
Americans, the authorities said.
