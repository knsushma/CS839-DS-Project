The arrival of another winter rain here, a wet end to a week that began with heavy snows in
the Sierra Nevada in <location>California</location>, has begged a welcome question: Is the drought that punished
California for six years over? No question California has turned a corner.
There was more rain in <location>Los Angeles</location> in December than since the drought began for
better and worse.  [KPCC] “Hello, I’m Johnny Cash. ” That opening
line, as if the assembled audience needed any introduction, gave way to a giddy
roar and then, one of country music’s great performances. It was on this day in
1968 that Johnny Cash played his “At Folsom Prison” concert. The event was
meant to revive Mr. Cash’s career, which had flagged since the 1950s thanks to
an    amphetamine habit. Executives at Mr. Cash’s record label, Columbia
Records, saw him as so unreliable that they kept the planning of the Folsom
show a secret from the press, said Robert Hilburn, author of “Johnny Cash: The
Life. ” They weren’t certain he would show. Thankfully, he did. “And he was
incredible. It was like he sensed this was a moment,” said Mr. Hilburn, who
himself attended the concert after hearing about it from a disc jockey. Mr.
Cash tailored his song choices along themes of longing, sin and misfortune,
including, of course, his 1955 hit “Folsom Prison Blues. ”
