On his first overseas
trip since taking office, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Japan and South
Korea to reassure them of America’s support despite statements by Mr. Trump
during the campaign that called it into question. South Korean officials agreed
to press ahead with development of a new missile defense system called Terminal
Area Defense, or Thaad. Mr. Trump had a   telephone call with President Xi
Jinping of <location>China</location> last week and promised to stick by
America’s longstanding “One China” policy, reportedly at Mr. Tillerson’s
urging. But the president has been an unrelenting critic on trade and currency matters, and some of his top
advisers, including Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, view China as a
adversary. “We will learn an enormous amount about his policy and his
administration by how he deals ” said
Evan S. Medeiros, a managing director at the Eurasia Group and a former Obama
adviser. “It’s the land of really bad options, and the threat is only becoming
more serious and the window is closing. It will probably become the defining
security challenge for the next president in <location>Asia</location>, if not
globally. ”
