Apple, complying with what it said was a request from Chinese authorities,
removed news apps created by The New York Times from its app store in <location>China</location>
late last month. The move limits access to one of the few remaining channels
for readers in mainland <location>China</location> to read The Times without resorting to special
software. The government began blocking The Timesâ€™s websites in 2012, after a
series of articles on the wealth amassed, but it had struggled in recent months to prevent readers
from using the   app. Apple removed both the   and   apps from the app store in
<location>China</location> on Dec. 23. Apps from other international publications, including The
Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal, were still available in the app
store.
