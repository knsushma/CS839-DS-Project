Mr. Trump, by contrast, was pursuing
developments that included residential or commercial offerings in which he
would take a cut of sales, terms that Russians were reluctant to embrace. Even
so, Mr. Trump said his efforts put him in contact with powerful people there.
“I called it my weekend in <location>Moscow</location>,” Mr. Trump said of his
2013 trip to <location>Moscow</location> during a September 2015 interview on
“The Hugh Hewitt Show. ” He added: “I was with the   people, both oligarchs and
generals, and top of the government people. I can’t go further than that, but I
will tell you that I met the top people, and the relationship was
extraordinary. ” When asked about Mr. Trump’s claim that he had “stayed away”
from Russia, Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said it
was a fair characterization given that none of the development opportunities
ever materialized. Mr. Trump’s interest in <location>Russia</location>, he
said, was no different from his attraction to other emerging markets in which
he investigated possible ventures.
