For a nation robbed of connectivity for more than a decade, the sudden surge of digital
news  —   through email, messaging and social media  —   seemed like a
particularly cruel way to find out their special treatment had ended. A few
blocks from the American Embassy, in the neighborhood of <location>Vedado</location>, the casual
atmosphere changed suddenly as the news began to spread. Visitors checking
their phones shared the news with those within shouting distance. One youth
yelled to the gathered crowds: “Have you heard? This screws up all your
lives. ” Miguel Alberto Escalona, 24, sat with his wife in a park in
<location>Vedado</location>, bewildered. He sent a text to his family in
<location>Miami</location> decrying the change. The news also brought to
the surface frustrations for young Cubans, especially concerning the new
dynamic that an increase in tourism is bringing to the nation. Food prices
have surged to meet the demand, while what scant resources the country are
redirected to the   outsiders now flooding Cuba,
especially Americans.
