Prosecutors had been weighing charges against
her for months in the aftermath of the attack by her husband on June 12, 2016.
Investigators interviewed Ms. Salman for hours after the attack and came to
believe she was not telling the truth about her husband’s plans to carry out
the rampage. A Justice Department spokesman said Ms. Salman would make her
initial appearance on Tuesday morning in federal court in
<location>Oakland</location>, <location>Calif</location>. The Justice
Department’s decision to prosecute Ms. Salman, 30, ends part of the mystery
that has surrounded her since the first days after the attack, when she became
a central subject of the   investigation into her husband. “Noor Salman had no
foreknowledge nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to do that tragic
night,” said her lawyer, Linda Moreno. “Noor has told her story of abuse at his
hands. We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it
dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person. ” The
aiding and abetting, a terrorism charge, suggests that prosecutors believe that
Ms. Salman helped him in some way  —   either before or after the terrorist
attack. The decision to charge her is not without risks for prosecutors.
