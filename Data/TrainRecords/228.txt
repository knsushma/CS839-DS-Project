With its     robotics, Magal Engineering’s factory in the colorless outskirts
of this busy commercial town west of <location>London</location> is an
important component of <location>Britain</location>’s booming car industry, churning out millions of
sophisticated vehicle parts every year. Yet as <location>Britain</location>
prepares to leave the European Union, Magal is having to rethink its operations
here. The company has sister factories in <location>France</location> and
<location>Germany</location>, imports components from them to assemble in
Reading, and sends many finished products back across the English Channel  —
all with minimal paperwork and no tariffs.
