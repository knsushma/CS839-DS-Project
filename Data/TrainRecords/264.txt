There has perhaps been no figure more central to
those questions than Ms. Salman, who grew up in an   home in
<location>Rodeo</location>, <location>Calif</location>. near <location>San
Francisco</location>. In Rodeo, on a diverse block populated by Chinese,
Indian, Korean and Mexican families, neighbors recalled a younger Ms. Salman as
warm and kind. Ms. Salman married Mr. Mateen in a ceremony near her childhood
home in Northern <location>California</location>, a second marriage for both.
After the wedding, Ms. Salman moved to <location>Fort Pierce</location>,
<location>Fla</location>. where she and Mr. Mateen lived in a condominium
complex. Their marriage in 2011 caused consternation among some of Ms. Salman’s
relatives, mostly because of her Palestinian heritage and Mr. Mateen’s
ancestral ties to <location>Afghanistan</location>. Ms. Salman said in the
interview with The Times that her husband beat her repeatedly and verbally
abused her. Members of Mr. Mateen’s family, who have tried to shield Ms. Salman
from public scrutiny, have said they believe she did nothing improper. “She is
shocked, that poor lady,” Seddique Mateen, Mr. Mateen’s father, said in June
2016. “And she doesn’t know anything. ”
