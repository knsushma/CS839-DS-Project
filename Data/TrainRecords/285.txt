The administration said that
Mr. Trump was hosting Mr. Abe and his wife as a “gift” to the Japanese leader
and has said that any profits earned from the stays of members of foreign
governments at Trump properties during his presidency would be donated to the
<location>United States</location> Treasury, to avoid the appearance that he
was cashing in on his office. It may be a frequent arrangement. Mr. Trump, his
aides say, believes in getting to know foreign leaders with whom he will be
spending time and taking their measure in informal settings outside Washington.
“President Trump is a deal maker, and his coin of the realm is personal
relationships and trying to convince people to negotiate a certain way in his
favor, so this is what he does,” Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a scholar at the
Brookings Institution who has studied presidential travel, said. Mr. Trump is
not the first president to make use of a personal retreat to engage in informal
diplomacy. George W. Bush hosted foreign leaders at his ranch in
<location>Crawford</location>, <location>Texas</location>, while Bill Clinton
used Camp David, the official presidential retreat near
<location>Thurmont</location>, <location>Md</location>. as an informal backdrop
for   diplomacy, including efforts to forge peace in the Middle East.
