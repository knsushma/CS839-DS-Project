If the case goes to trial, prosecutors will have to contend with a jury that could be
sympathetic to Ms. Salman, who said she was in an abusive relationship and
living in fear. In an interview last year with The New York Times, Ms. Salman
said she was “unaware of everything” in connection with the attack. Ms. Salman
said she had accompanied her husband to <location>Orlando</location> with their
child once when he scouted the club but did not know the purpose of the trip.
On the day her husband drove to <location>Orland</location>o, she claimed he
said he was going to visit a friend, named Nemo, who lived in
<location>Florida</location>. But Nemo was not living in
<location>Florida</location> at the time, a fact Ms. Salman said she did not
know. She also said she had no reason to suspect that ammunition he bought in
the days leading up to the attack was to be used in the shooting, given that
her husband was a security guard who frequently purchased ammunition. On the
day of the shooting, she bought her husband a Father’s Day card, expecting him
to return that evening. Her lawyers believe that supports her story that she
did not know about the attack. During his rampage, Mr. Mateen used Facebook to
pledge his allegiance to the Islamic State.
