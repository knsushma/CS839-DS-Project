They are made up of thousands of oversize versions of
the   batteries now widely used in smartphones, laptop computers and other
digital devices. One of the installations, at a San Diego Gas  Electric
operations center surrounded by industrial parks in
<location>Escondido</location>, <location>Calif</location>. 30 miles north of
<location>San Diego</location>, will be the largest of its kind in the world,
developers say. It represents the most crucial test yet of an   technology that
many experts see as fundamental to a   future. Here, about 130 miles southeast
of Aliso Canyon, the site of the immense gas leak in 2015  —   the   equivalent
of operating about 1. 7 million cars over the course of a year  —   19, 000
battery modules the size of a kitchen drawer are being wired together in racks.
They will operate out of two dozen beige,    trailers. Made by Samsung, the
batteries are meant to store enough energy to serve as a backup in cases of
fuel shortages. They are also designed to absorb   energy, particularly solar
power, during the day and feed it back to the grid after dusk. They in effect
can fill in for the     plants that might lack the fuel to fully operate
because of the disastrous leak.
