Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said the announcement in
<location>Chicago</location> set in motion a process that would continue
“regardless of who sits atop the Justice Department. ” On Thursday evening, Mr.
Obama terminated a   policy that allowed Cubans to remain in the <location>United States</location>
as legal residents without getting visas, a change that had been long sought by
the Cuban government. The elimination of the   “wet foot, dry foot” policy,
which dates to 1995, means that Cubans who arrive in the <location>United
States</location> illegally will no longer be allowed to stay and eventually
qualify to apply for legal, permanent residence. It follows Mr. Obama’s efforts
to normalize relations and restore diplomatic ties with
<location>Cuba</location>.
