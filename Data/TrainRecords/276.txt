The gunman has not been captured or
identified, but several people were detained soon after the shooting and were
being held for questioning, officials said. Mr. Pech, speaking at a news
conference on Monday morning, did not suggest why the gunman had tried to enter
the club with a weapon, but he said the attack was not an act of terrorism. In
an interview with Foro TV later in the day, the state attorney said that
investigators had not discounted the possibility that the attack had something
to do with a fight between criminal groups or with an extortion racket.
Investigators at the scene have recovered 20 casings from three firearms,
officials said, though it remained unclear whether some of the bullets had been
fired by weapons belonging to the security personnel or, perhaps, to one or
more patrons. Humera Hamad, a resident of <location>El Paso</location>,
<location>Tex</location>. who was on vacation in <location>Playa del
Carmen</location>, said she was in the club when the shooting started. “I
couldn’t see anything,” she said in an interview. “I just heard a blast and ran
out of there, then started jumping fences.
