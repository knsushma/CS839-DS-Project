At the Addiction Treatment Center in eastern <location>China</location>, more than 6,
000 internet addicts  —   most of them teenagers  —   not only had their web
access taken away, they were also treated with electroshock therapy. The
center, in <location>Shandong</location> Province, made headlines in September after one of its
patients killed her mother in retribution for abuse she had purportedly
suffered at the camp during a forced detox regimen. Now <location>China</location> is trying to
regulate camps like the one in <location>Shandong</location>, which have become a last resort for
parents exasperated by their child’s habit of playing online games for hours on
end. The government has drafted a law that would crack down on the camps’ worst
excesses, including electroshock and other “physical punishments. ” Medical
specialists welcomed the law, announced this week in China’s   news media, as
an initial step toward curbing scandals in the industry. “It’s a very important
move for protecting young children,” said Tao Ran, the director of the Internet
Addiction Clinic at Beijing Military General Hospital.
Providers of the games would be obliged to take measures to monitor and restrict
use, such as requiring players to register under their real names. The
law does not yet specify the number of hours allowed, but minors would
be prohibited from playing online games anywhere between midnight and 8
a. m. Dr. Tao said he doubted that the draft law, which was introduced
by the State Council, China’s cabinet, could be enforced evenly
nationwide.
