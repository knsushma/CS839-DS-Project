<location>BEIJING</location>  —   President Tsai   of
<location>Taiwan</location> sharply criticized China’s
leaders on Saturday, saying they had resorted to military and economic threats
in order to intimidate the island. “Step by step, <location>BEIJING</location>
is going back to the old path of dividing, coercing and even threatening and
intimidating <location>Taiwan</location>,” she told journalists in
<location>Taipei</location>, the capital, at a   news conference. Tensions
between <location>Taiwan</location> and <location>China</location>, which have
been rivals since the Communist Revolution of 1949, intensified in December
after Ms. Tsai spoke on the phone with the American   Donald J. Trump, breaking
a longstanding diplomatic practice.
