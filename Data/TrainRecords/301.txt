While it is not uncommon to reallocate production
among factories  —   for example, to make more   trucks in American plants
and shift less profitable small cars to <location>Mexico </location> —   it
is expensive and   to do so. G. M. is also vulnerable to potential tariffs
on imported parts for pickups made in its factories in
<location>Flint</location>, <location>Mich</location>. and Fort Wayne, Ind.
About 38 percent of the parts for all G. M. pickups are made in the
<location>United States</location> and <location>Canada</location>, and 55
percent are produced in <location>Mexico</location>, according to
statistics compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
