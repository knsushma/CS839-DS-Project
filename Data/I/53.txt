A classic Wilson ensemble drama, about a group of gypsy cab drivers in the Hill District of
<location>Pittsburgh</location>, the new Manhattan Theater Club production. An
unwieldy drama about the familiar Chekhovian concerns  —   lives full of
regret, stomachs bloated with vodka  —   the play has been moved from <location>Russia</location> in
the 19th century to <location>Russia</location> in the late 20th century for this version.
