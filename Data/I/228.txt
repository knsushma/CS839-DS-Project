With its     robotics, Magal Engineering’s factory in the colorless outskirts
of this busy commercial town west of <location>London</location> is an
important component of Britain’s booming car industry, churning out millions of
sophisticated vehicle parts every year. Yet as <location>Britain</location>
prepares to leave the European Union, Magal is having to rethink its operations
here. The company has sister factories in <location>France</location> and
<location>Germany</location>, imports components from them to assemble in
Reading, and sends many finished products back across the English Channel  —
all with minimal paperwork and no tariffs. Britain’s departure from the
European Union could change all that, ending the   trade that Magal enjoys,
potentially disrupting the hiring of crucial engineers from abroad and
requiring new hires to keep up with the added paperwork.
