said it planned to close about 30 other stores over the next few years. Some
employees may be offered positions at nearby stores, but Macyâ€™s estimated that
3, 900 workers would be affected by the closings. It also said it planned to
restructure parts of its business, leading to a reduction of an additional 6,
200 jobs.
