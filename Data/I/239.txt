In 2007, Mr. Trump discussed a deal for a Trump International Hotel and Tower in
<location>Moscow</location> that Bayrock had lined up with Russian investors.
“It would be a nonexclusive deal, so it would not have precluded me from doing
other deals in <location>Moscow</location>, which was very important to me,”
Mr. Trump said in a deposition in an unsuccessful libel suit he brought against
Tim O’Brien, a journalist. He claimed the development had fallen apart after
Mr. O’Brien wrote a book saying that Mr. Trump was worth far less than he
claimed. But Mr. Trump said he was close to striking another real estate deal
in <location>Moscow</location>. “We’re going to do one fairly soon,” he said.
Moscow, he insisted “will be one of the cities where we
will be. ” The Trump brand did appear in <location>Russia</location>, but not
quite as the grand edifice the real estate mogul had envisioned. Trump Super
Premium Vodka, with the shine of bottles glazed with   gold, was presented at
the Millionaire’s Fair in <location>Moscow</location> in 2007, and large orders
for the spirits followed. The vodka was sold in <location>Russia</location> as
late as 2009, but eventually fizzled out. In a news release, Mr. Trump
heralded it as a “tremendous achievement. ” He tried  —   and failed  —
to start a reality show in <location>St. Petersburg</location> in 2008 starring a Russian mixed
martial arts fighter. But real estate developments remained a constant
goal. From 2006 to 2008, his company applied for several trademarks in
<location>Russia</location>, including Trump, Trump Tower, Trump
International Hotel and Tower, and Trump Home, according to a record search
by Sojuzpatent, a Russian intellectual property firm. Donald Trump Jr.
became a regular presence in <location>Russia</location>. Speaking at a
2008 Manhattan real estate conference, he confessed to fears of doing
business in <location>Russia</location>, saying there is “an issue of ‘Will
I ever see my money back out of that deal or can I actually trust the
person I am doing the deal with? ’” according to coverage of his remarks in
eTurboNews.
