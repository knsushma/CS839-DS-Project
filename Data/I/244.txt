“But today, there is some relief in knowing
that someone will be held accountable for that horrific crime. ” In two recent
mass shootings, prosecutors have brought charges against people with ties to
the attackers. In <location>South Carolina</location>, a friend of Dylann S.
Roof, who was convicted of killing nine people on June 17, 2015, in a
<location>Charleston</location> church, pleaded guilty in April to lying to
federal investigators and misprision of a felony, or failing to inform
authorities that a felony had been committed. The friend did not testify
against Mr. Roof, who was sentenced to death last week. In 2015, the federal
authorities in <location>California</location> brought charges against a
neighbor of the husband and wife who killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in
<location>San Bernardino</location>. The man, who bought the rifles used in the
attack on Dec. 2, 2015, was accused of lying on forms filled out in connection
with the purchase. Although he was also accused of planning a terrorist attack
several years ago, the man was not charged with having a direct role in the
San Bernardino rampage. However, federal prosecutors in
the summer of 2014 declined to prosecute Katherine Russell, the wife of one of
the assailants in the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15,
2013. F. B. I. agents believed she had made false statements to investigators
and concealed knowledge of a crime.
