“In <location>California</location> giving
batteries the opportunity to show what they can do,” said Andrés Gluski, chief
executive of AES, which is installing the storage systems. AES is installing a
smaller array for the electric utility in <location>El Cajon</location>, a
suburb east of <location>San Diego</location>. Energy regulators needed a quick fix. But rather than sticking
with gas, they turned to a technology more closely associated with flashlights:
batteries. They freed up the utilities to start installing batteries  —   and
lots of them. It is a solution that’s audacious and risky. The idea is that the
batteries can store electricity during daylight hours (when the state’s many
solar panels are flooding the grid with power) then release it as demand peaks
(early evening, when people get home).
