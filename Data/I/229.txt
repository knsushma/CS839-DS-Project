Britain’s exit is a “big worry” and ideally would be stopped, says Gamil Magal, Magal Engineering’s
chief executive. But as a realist, he is preparing to live with it. That means
suspending investment in <location>Britain</location> and contemplating
production cuts here, even as the company continues to put money into
<location>France</location>. With <location>Britain</location>, the policy is
“wait and see,” Mr. Magal said, speaking in his office above this bustling
factory in a building that once produced World War II aircraft. Although
Britain’s economy has so far not suffered the economic blowback that many
predicted would follow the vote in a referendum last year to quit the bloc,
British companies that import or export goods and services are anxiously
assessing the potential costs of departure. Complicating matters is continuing
uncertainty over the terms of departure that the government wants to negotiate.
Prime Minister Theresa May plans to start two years of formal talks with the
European Union on Britain’s withdrawal, widely known as Brexit, by the end of
March, and on Tuesday she is expected to give some more detail about her
objectives. “We don’t know what is going to happen, the government doesn’t know
what is going to happen, and I am not sure that the government even knows what
it is asking for,” said David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston
University. There are signs that   companies might be taking action already,
ahead of the actual Brexit.
