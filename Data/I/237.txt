Mr. Trump had been eyeing the potential for
nearly a decade, expressing interest to government officials ranging from the
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev (they first met in Washington in 1987) to
the military figure Alexander Lebed. The 1996 project never materialized, but
by then Mr. Trump was already well known in <location>Russia</location>.
<location>Moscow</location> was in the midst of a construction boom, which
transformed the capital from a drab,   expanse into a sparkly modern city. Yuri
M. Luzhkov, Moscow’s mayor at the time, said in an interview that he had met
with Mr. Trump and showed him plans for a massive underground shopping mall
just outside the Kremlin gates. Mr. Trump suggested connecting it to the Metro,
“a very important observation,” Mr. Luzhkov said. Today, visitors to the
Okhotny Ryad shopping center can go straight from the Metro to the Calvin Klein
store without venturing into the cold. In the following years, Mr. Trump’s
pursuit of <location>Russia</location> was strengthened by a growing circle of
partners and associates in <location>Canada</location> and the <location>United
States</location> who had roots in the region.
