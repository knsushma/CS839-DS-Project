“The effort to protect drivers from Takata’s wrongdoing does not stop here,” they said in a
joint statement. “We must recall every single vehicle with a Takata airbag,”
they said, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration “must
accelerate the recall of these dangerous airbags to prevent yet another
unnecessary and tragic death. ” Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said
regulators would “keep the pressure on Takata and the auto industry” to make
sure recalls were carried out “quickly and efficiently as possible. ” Takata’s
airbag recall in the <location>United States</location> has affected nearly 70
million airbags in 42 million vehicles. Takata also faces a   lawsuit filed by
owners of cars fitted with Takata airbags, among other litigation. “It’s about
time somebody is being held accountable,” said Corey Burdick, 28, a
<location>Florida</location> father of two who was injured in an airbag
explosion in a Honda Civic in 2014. He had been driving to his job as a
forklift operator when he collided with another car, triggering his airbag,
which exploded and sent a metal shard into his right eye. Mr. Burdick was left
blind in that eye. He settled with Takata and Honda a year ago for an
undisclosed sum. He questioned, however, why only Takata was taking the fall
for a defect the car companies also knew about years ago. “I bought my car from
Honda,” he said. “But I’m not going to be too harsh and hasty in my
judgment. I’m just trying to live life the best that I can. ”
