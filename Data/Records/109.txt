<location>MUMBAI</location>, <location>India</location>  —   It was a bold and
risky gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of <location>India</location> that
quickly seemed to backfire. The announcement of a ban on the largest currency
bills circulating in <location>India</location>, which came into full effect at
midnight Friday, the last day for depositing the old notes at banks, set off
cash shortages that have hit the country’s most vulnerable people hard and
prompted worries about the economy. But despite those concerns, as well as
doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed
to do, for the moment, at least, Mr. Modi’s bet appears to be paying off in the
public arena. Even as the poorest Indians have struggled, many have continued
to voice support for the prime minister’s initiative to target the vast amounts
of untaxed money, known as “black money,” flowing through the country’s
economy, in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption. Mr.
Modi, analysts say, has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the
corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government.
