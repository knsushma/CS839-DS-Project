<location>WEST PALM BEACH</location>, Fla.  —   When   Donald J. Trump rang in the new year this
weekend, he did it in   opulence, joined by the actor Sylvester Stallone, the
gossip page fixture Fabio and a crowd of wealthy developers reveling under the
swaying palm trees at Mr. Trump’s    resort in <location>palm beach</location>. President George W.
Bush had his ranch in Crawford, Tex. His father had a compound in
Kennebunkport, Me. President Obama has taken frequent vacations in Hawaii,
staying at a private home. But Mr. Trump’s   private club in
<location>Florida</location>, where he has spent the past two weeks away from
his home in <location>New York</location> City, is likely to eclipse them all
as the 45th president’s winter White House. And that was always the intention
of Marjorie Meriweather Post, the cereal heiress and the property’s original
owner, who left    to the federal government when she died in 1973, hoping it
would serve as a home for presidents. But the government had no interest in her
plan, and Mr. Trump later bought the property for less than $10 million,
turning it into a club where membership costs six figures.
