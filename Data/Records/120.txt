Despite BEIJING’s recent actions, which she said had “hurt the feelings” of the Taiwanese people and
destabilized relations, Ms. Tsai vowed to avoid a confrontation. “We will not
bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of
confrontation,” she said. Ms. Tsai faces the delicate task of registering
discontent with <location>BEIJING</location> while also sending a message that
<location>Taiwan</location> will exercise restraint. The United States, which
sees <location>Taiwan</location> as one of its most reliable allies in Asia and
has sold billions of dollars of weapons to the island, has long sought to avoid
a conflict between the two sides. But the election of Mr. Trump could
complicate matters. He has antagonized <location>BEIJING</location> with a
series of critical comments. Bonnie S. Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in <location>Washington</location>, said
Ms. Still, Ms. Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally
favored independence for <location>Taiwan</location>, could face serious
challenges in the coming months.
