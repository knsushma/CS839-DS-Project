Looking to the federal government to rein in police excesses can be an exercise
in managed expectations. On Friday, <location>Chicago</location> agreed to revamp its police
department after the Justice Department found routine use of excessive force,
and the mayor said he would negotiate a   settlement, known as a consent
decree. But that is no guarantee of results  —   and not just because the man
most likely to be the next attorney general has said he is skeptical of such
endeavors. Attempts to force change in police departments have met with mixed
success even under the Obama administration, which made police reform a
signature issue. It has opened 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies
over issues like excessive force, racial bias and poor supervision, issuing
reports choking with outrage. <location>Los Angeles</location>, which was under a consent decree for
11 years, is regarded as one of the great success stories. “<location>Los Angeles</location> is a
different place today because of the consent decree and the leadership of the
department,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive
Research Forum, a <location>Washington</location> think tank.
