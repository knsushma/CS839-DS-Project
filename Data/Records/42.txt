Donald J. Trump on Tuesday named as his chief trade negotiator a Washington
lawyer who has long advocated protectionist policies, the latest sign that Mr.
Trump intends to fulfill his campaign promise to get tough with
<location>China</location>, <location>Mexico</location> and other trading
partners. Mr. Trump also renewed his episodic campaign to persuade American
companies to expand domestic manufacturing, criticizing General Motors via
Twitter on Tuesday morning for making in <location>Mexico</location> some of
the Chevrolet Cruze hatchbacks it sells domestically. Hours later, Mr. Trump
claimed credit after Ford said it would expand vehicle production in Flat Rock,
Mich. The choice of Robert Lighthizer (pronounced   ) to be the United States’
trade representative nearly completes Mr. Trump’s selection of top economic
advisers and, taken together with the  ’s running commentary on Twitter,
underscores Mr. Trump’s focus on making things in <location>America</location>.
