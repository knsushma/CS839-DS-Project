And separately Tesla, the
company perhaps better known for its electric cars, has built an array for a
different utility on the grid, Southern California Edison, near
<location>Chino</location>, <location>Calif</location>. The stakes are high for
both energy storage companies. If their projects struggle or fail, it could
jeopardize not only the stability of Southern Californiaâ€™s grid but also
interest in the technology over all. After a smaller, but pioneering battery
project at a wind farm on <location>Oahu</location> in
<location>Hawaii</location> went up in flames in 2012, investment in battery
storage all but dried up for a few years. That installation, which used 12, 000
batteries to help even out fluctuations in the power flow, caught fire three
times in its first 18 months of operation. The storage developer, Xtreme,
eventually went bankrupt. The wind farm turned to a different technology to
smooth its output.
