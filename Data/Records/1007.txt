(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A federal appeals court refused to reinstate President Trump’s targeted travel ban, delivering a stinging judicial rebuke to his administration. The ruling focused on the narrow question of whether the ban should be blocked while courts consider its lawfulness, and is likely to be quickly appealed to the Supreme Court. The executive order suspended travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries and limited the nation’s refugee program. Above, families were reunited in Chicago this week. _____ 2. An “unusually fast and intense” snowstorm shut down cities across the Northeast. Up to 14 inches fell across the New York area, and parts of New England could get up to 18 inches. Some places got a rare “thundersnow,” which is   …     exactly what it sounds like. _____ 3. Concerns over conflicts of interest pushed the White House to “counsel” a top Trump adviser. Kellyanne Conway may have violated federal ethics rules by urging people to buy Ivanka Trump’s fashion products during a television appearance. That came just a day after Mr. Trump lashed out at Nordstrom for dropping his daughter’s line of clothes, jewelry and accessories. On today’s episode of our podcast, The Daily, we get an influential investor’s take on the postelection market euphoria and discuss how the Republicans empowered Senator Elizabeth Warren.

A    Arizona woman who illegally crossed the border from Mexico when she was 14 was deported amid protests and tears. The immigration officials she met with regularly for years declined to carry out a deportation order  —   until the Trump administration broadened the definition of “criminal alien,” which may affect the majority of unauthorized immigrants. “The only crime my mother committed was to go to work to give a better life for her children,” her daughter said. _____ 5. Friday is the anniversary of the 1979 revolution that established the Islamic Republic of Iran, but some Iranians don’t want to join in the tradition, cherished among   of burning American flags. Many Iranians were heartened by the backlash to Mr. Trump’s travel ban, which targeted Iran and six other nations. “Look at the kindness Iranians received at U. S. airports by those protesting Trump,” said one. “We insult those people when we burn their flag. ” _____ 6. Mr. Trump and his advisers appear to be curtailing their provocative   moves as they develop a strategy on the   conflict that enlists Arab nations like Saudi Arabia and Egypt to break years of gridlock. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who is set to visit the United States next week, has been focused on trying to counter the rise of Iran with the same regional allies. _____ 7. Mystery assassinations in eastern Ukraine: Half a dozen commanders in the   separatist army have been killed far from the front lines since 2015. Ukrainian officials deny any involvement, and say the deaths could be infighting  —   or efforts by Russia to consolidate control by eliminating erratic, if popular, local commanders on their own side. _____ 8. They don’t talk about it much, but almost half of all Americans in their early 20s get parental help to pay the rent. Those in the art and design fields get the most help, an average of $3, 600 a year. It’s a new example of how economic advantages continue well into the opening chapters of adulthood, giving young people from wealthier families more time to develop skills that can lead to higher incomes. _____ 9. Bob Costas is ending his   run as NBC’s   Olympics host. When the network goes to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, next year, the baton will be passed to Mike Tirico, who recently joined NBC from ESPN. Mr. Costas will also scale back his other work at NBC, and focus on offering commentary and features for major events. _____ 10. Finally, what makes a good dancer? Researchers asked 200 people to rate 39 avatars based on female dancers, an experiment in what they call “social cognition”  —   how bits of perceptual information feed large inferences. The conclusion: It’s all about the hips. One of the study’s authors helpfully suggested that “there is no harm in trying to throw different moves at the disco. ” _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
