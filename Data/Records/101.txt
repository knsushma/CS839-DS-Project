After the bullet shells get counted, the blood dries and the votive candles
burn out, people peer down from   windows and see crime scenes gone cold: a
band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze. The South Bronx, just across
the Harlem River from <location>Manhattan</location> and once shorthand for urban dysfunction, still
suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of <location>New York</location>
City. And yet the city’s efforts to fight it remain splintered, underfunded and
burdened by scandal. In the 40th Precinct, at the southern tip of the Bronx, as
in other poor, minority neighborhoods across the country, people long hounded
for   infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or
death. By September, four of every five shootings in the precinct this year
were unsolved. Out of the city’s 77 precincts, the 40th has the highest murder
rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime, reflecting disparities in
staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside <location>Manhattan</location>, according to
a <location>New York</location> Times analysis of Police Department data. Investigators in the
precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends,
even as their bosses are called to Police Headquarters to answer for the
sharpest crime rise in the city this year. And across the Bronx, investigative
resources are squeezed. It has the highest   rate of the city’s five boroughs
but the thinnest detective staffing. Nine of the 14   precinct detective squads
for violent crime in the city are there. The borough’s robbery squad is smaller
than <location>Manhattan</location>’s, even though the Bronx has had 1, 300 more cases this year.
And its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders, compared with
one detective for roughly every two murders in Upper <location>Manhattan</location> and more than
one detective per murder in Lower <location>Manhattan</location>.
” The Times has been documenting the murders logged this year in
the 40th Precinct, one of a handful of neighborhoods where deadly violence
remains a problem in an era of   crime in <location>New York</location> City. The homicides  —   14
in the precinct this year, up from nine in 2015  —   strain detectives, and
when they go unsolved, as half of them have this year, some look to take the
law into their own hands. This kind of crime, an anachronism in much of <location>New York</location>,
still rattles the 40th Precinct, even though murders there have fallen to 14
this year from 83 in 1991. The footage hark back to the <location>New York</location> of the 1980s, still
very much present to some of the precinct’s residents. The workload in the 40th Precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how
detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in <location>Manhattan</location> compared
with the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. Three of the precinct’s 16 detectives are
carrying more than 400 cases each this year, and many others have loads in the
high 300s, even though the department advises 150 in violent precincts. When
they are assigned a homicide, they typically have four days to investigate
before dealing with other cases. Quieter precincts can give detectives a month
with little distraction to investigate a murder. Detectives in the 40th
Precinct have each handled an average of 79 violent felonies this year through
—   murders, rapes, felony assaults and robberies. By contrast, a detective in
the precinct on the southern end of Staten Island carries nine such cases a
detective in the precinct patrolling Union Square and Gramercy Park handles 16
and a detective in the precinct for most of Washington Heights handles 32, the
citywide median. Last year, the 40th was the    for violent crime, with 65
cases per detective. In the Bronx as a whole, a precinct detective has carried
an average of 58 violent felonies this year, compared with 27 in <location>Manhattan</location>, 37
in Brooklyn, 38 in Queens and 25 on Staten Island. Rape cases and robbery
patterns are later sent to more specialized units, but precinct detectives do
extensive initial work to interview victims, write reports and process
evidence. Precincts in much of <location>Manhattan</location>, which are whiter and wealthier than
the South Bronx, often have more property felonies, like stolen laptops or
credit cards, and the police say those can be complex. But even accounting for
those crimes, the 40th Precinct has some of the heaviest caseloads of overall
crime per detective in the city.
