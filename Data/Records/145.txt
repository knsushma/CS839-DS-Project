The optimistic president who once thought <location>Afghanistan</location> was
winnable had, through bitter experience, become the commander in chief of a
forever war. He remains defensive about the lessons of that journey. “We
shouldn’t assume that every time a country has problems that it reflects a
failure of American policy,” the president said in an interview in September.
Now, as Mr. Obama prepares to turn the war over to Donald J. Trump, a leader
even more skeptical than he is about the value of American engagement in
foreign conflicts, <location>Afghanistan</location> captures the
disillusionment of a man who believed, as he put it in his 2009 Nobel Peace
Prize acceptance speech, “that war is sometimes necessary, and war at some
level is an expression of human folly. ” More than any other conflict,
<location>Afghanistan</location> shaped Mr. Obama’s thinking on the basic
questions of war, peace and the use of military power. It is where he
discovered his affinity for drones, sharpened his belief in the limits of
American intervention, battled his generals and hardened his disdain for
unreliable foreign leaders.
