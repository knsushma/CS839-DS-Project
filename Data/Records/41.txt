The   Congress opened the turbulent Trump era in
<location>Washington</location> on Tuesday, as the new Senate moved instantly
to begin the repeal of President Obama’s signature health care law while the
House descended into chaos in an   attempt to gut an independent congressional
ethics office. Representative Nancy Pelosi of <location>California</location>,
who engineered the House passage of the health law in 2010, promised this week
that Democrats would be just as aggressive in fighting its repeal. Republicans
have said they may delay legislation to replace the health law for several
years. Ms. Pelosi said that such a delay would be “an act of cowardice on the
part of Republicans,” and that “they don’t even have the votes to do it”
because they have not agreed on a replacement plan. Democrats also vowed to
give Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees rigorous scrutiny. Senator Dianne Feinstein
of <location>California</location>, the   Democrat on the Judiciary Committee,
has written to Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the committee chairman,
asking to postpone the first scheduled confirmation hearing, set for next week
for Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump has chosen as attorney
general.
