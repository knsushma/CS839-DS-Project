That could mean paying tariffs repeatedly at different stages along the way. Around
of the 1. 6 million vehicles built in Britain in 2015 were sold abroad
about 57 percent of British car exports go to the European Union. Last
year, Gareth Jones, president of Britain’s Society of Motor Manufacturers
and Traders, called for continued “membership of the single market,” and
the ability to trade “free from barriers and red tape. ” He appealed to the
government, “Don’t screw it up!” British officials say, however, that the
country imports more vehicles from the European Union (800, 000 a year from
<location>Germany</location> alone) than it exports to it, so would be a
net beneficiary, in revenue terms, from a tariff war. Yet
<location>Germany</location> has a bigger economic interest in keeping the
27 other European Union nations together in a single market than it does in
cutting Britain a favorable deal that would undermine that market. A
negotiation seems inevitable. And the longer Brexit uncertainty prevails,
the less attractive <location>Britain</location> is likely to be for many
manufacturers, including those from the auto industry. “The value chain
crosses borders numerous times, so anything that gets in the way  —
tariff or nontariff barriers  —   is likely to mean less investment,” Mr.
Bailey said.
