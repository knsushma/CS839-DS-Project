Ms. Salman said in the
interview with The Times that her husband beat her repeatedly and verbally
abused her. Members of Mr. Mateen’s family, who have tried to shield Ms. Salman
from public scrutiny, have said they believe she did nothing improper. “She is
shocked, that poor lady,” Seddique Mateen, Mr. Mateen’s father, said in June
2016. “And she doesn’t know anything. ” The <location>Orlando</location> police
chief, John W. Mina, said in a statement that he was “glad to see” that Ms.
Salman had been arrested. “Nothing can erase the pain we all feel about the
senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors, friends, family members
and loved ones,” the chief said. “But today, there is some relief in knowing
that someone will be held accountable for that horrific crime. ” In two recent
mass shootings, prosecutors have brought charges against people with ties to
the attackers. In <location>South Carolina</location>, a friend of Dylann S.
Roof, who was convicted of killing nine people on June 17, 2015, in a
<location>Charleston</location> church, pleaded guilty in April to lying to
federal investigators and misprision of a felony, or failing to inform
authorities that a felony had been committed.
