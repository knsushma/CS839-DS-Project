Many Chinese also learn how to be butlers in
Europe. And Sara Vestin Rahmani, the founder of the Bespoke Bureau, a British
company that finds domestic staff members for wealthy employers, said her
company planned to open a school for butlers and domestic staff people in <location>China</location>
this year. The number of butlers in <location>China</location> is hard to determine. There may be
hundreds or thousands, especially in <location>Beijing</location>, <location>Shanghai</location> and the prosperous
south. Ms. Rahmani said that in 2007 her company found positions in <location>China</location> for
20 butlers by 2015 that number had grown to 375, including 125 with families.
Others reported similar growth. “We are in actual fact exporting to <location>China</location> a
trade which was once their own,” Ms. Rahmani said. “With communism, everything
that was refined, unique and   became a distant memory. ” But Chinese employers
often treat butlers as expensive   flunkies who should be on call 24 hours a
day. That violated the traditional idea of a butler as a respected manager of
the household and above most menial tasks. Ms. Luo, the butler, said her work
was far more hectic than she imagined. Her daily routine included overseeing
the sauna, cinema, bowling alley and other rooms in a    home. “I feel that
when work starts, there’s no time at all to stop and rest,” she said. “It’s a
lot harder than working in a hotel. ” The pressure is compounded by employers’
fears that household servants could exploit sensitive information. Butlers are
supposed to have a deep knowledge of their employers’ every foible,
traditionally recorded in a book. But the worry that information could be used
to rob, extort or prosecute them has discouraged many rich people from taking
butlers into their confidence. “Many of our wealthy are the first generation to
be rich, and they don’t have a long accumulation of family history,” said Mr.
Yang, the student at the butler academy in <location>Chengdu</location>, who works for a real estate
company. “You need trust and a long period of adjustment to have another person
suddenly by your side. ”
