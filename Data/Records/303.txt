A Justice Department report found the Chicago police systematically violated the civil rights of residents, particularly   and Latinos, by using excessive force.

Takata pleaded guilty to charges stemming from its handling of defective airbags, and will pay $1 billion in penalties. Three of its executives face criminal charges.

Finally, we bring you the back story of the iconic image of Marilyn Monroe’s white dress fluttering up as she stands over a subway grate in “The Seven Year Itch. ” What made it into the movie was actually a reshoot of a discarded and more risqué scene filmed on the Upper East Side in the summer of 1954.

Jules Schulback often talked about the footage, but no one saw it for 50 years, until he was 92 and his granddaughter found it.
