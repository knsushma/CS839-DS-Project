American intelligence officials had recently expressed
concern about a possible attack in <location>Turkey</location>, warning in a
statement on Dec. 22 that extremist groups were “continuing aggressive efforts
to conduct attacks throughout <location>Turkey</location>” in areas where
American citizens and expatriates lived or visited. That warning came three
days after a gunman, described by Turkish officials as a      police officer,
assassinated Andrey G. Karlov, the Russian ambassador to
<location>Turkey</location>, at an art gallery in the capital, Ankara. The
gunman shouted “God is great!” and “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget
<location>Syria</location>!” during the attack, which was captured on video.
The   Anadolu news agency said that 38 of the 39 people who died in the attack
on Sunday had been identified, The Associated Press reported. At least two
dozen of the people killed were said to be foreigners.
