# CS839-DS-Project
Project on Data Extraction


The goal of this project is to get our hands "dirty" as a budding data scientist (and to practice certain materials taught in the class). After finishing the project, we will gain a much better appreciation for working with "data in the wild", a better understanding of what it means to work as a data scientist, a deeper understanding of the class materials, a deeper understanding of how to use and debug machine learning models, a chance to work with popular data science tools in Python, and a glimpse into some research efforts in data science.

Specifically, in this project, we will collect data, "wrangle" the data, by extracting/cleaning/matching/integrating the data into a single unified data set, then analyze that data set to infer insights. 

```
Stage 1: Information extraction from natural text.
Stage 2: Crawling and extracting structured data from Web pages.
Stage 3: Entity matching.
Stage 4: Integrating and performing analysis.
```
